#Introduction

You are a dev with a problem. Imagine you've just created an issue linking to yui/yui3 issue #134.

Perhaps someone else on GitHub has also had your problem. Possibly they've solved it. How do you find them?

This is where the this tool comes in. It searches through cross-references made in GitHub comments, seeking out others in the community who've made the same link as you. You can narrow the time window to restrict results to only the more recent, or widen it for a broader scope. 

This tool is a proof of concept -- currently development focused on making the tool rather than maintaining the database it requires. As a result, it only works for GitHub data up to 2014. 

Plans to update the database to keep a live version were left with the SEGALabs team at the end end of the summer.

The final idea was to integrate this functionality directly with your GitHub account. That way you'd never have to enter any information by hand, simply use the GitHub Flavored Markdown as normal, and if you create a link to a project you can ask for suggestions from the tool.

#Usage
GitHub now has a similar feature. As a result, there are no plans to further develop this tool.

#Development
This protoype tool was conceptualized and mocked up over the sumer of 2015 while I was on an NSERC scholarship at SEGALabs at the University of Victoria.
