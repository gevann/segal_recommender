    <p class="lead">Possible integration</p>
    <p>
        This image is an idea of how the {{ tool_name }} could fit directly into a GitHub workflow.
        With integration into the GitHub account, the user would only have to type the same GitHub
        Flavored Markdown as they do to automatically generate a link and the tool would take care of
        the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
        All you'd need to do is click the button to let it know that you want some suggestions. Things
        like how many you want maximum, and how big a time window, could be set in your user profile 
        and forgotten until you wanted to modify them.
    </p>
